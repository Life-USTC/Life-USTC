# `General/Extensions/`

This folder contains some Swift functions or implementations that don't come with Swift, but are used throughout the app.

These functions and definitions should somehow be 'universal', meaning you could port them to another app whenever you want, and shall not contain definitions or logic like defined in `Models/`

**SwiftUI add-ons shall be put under `Views/Extensions/SwiftUIExtension.swift`**
