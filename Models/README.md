#  `Models`

This folder contains definitions and logics that supports the whole app,
no UI declarations shall be put under here to avoid messing up the structure.

It's a good practice to give same names to `Models/` and `Views/`, for example `PushNotification/`,
but you're not bounded to those rules.
